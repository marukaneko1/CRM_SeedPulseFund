## 🧪 **How to Debug:**

### **Step 1: Open Browser Console**
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/reminders
2. Press `F12` or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
3. Click **"Console"** tab
4. Clear console (🚫 icon)

### **Step 2: Create a Test Reminder**
1. Click **"Add Reminder"**
2. Title: **"Test Alarm"**
3. Description: **"Testing the alarm"**
4. Date/Time: **Set to 1-2 minutes from now**
5. Click **"Save"**

### **Step 3: Watch the Console**

You should see logs like this:

```
🔔 Starting reminder monitoring for 1 reminders
🔔 Initial reminder check after page load
🔔 Checking 1 reminders
🔔 Current time: 10/16/2025, 3:45:30 PM
🔔 Advance warning: 5 minutes
🔔 Will alert for reminders between now and 10/16/2025, 3:50:30 PM

```

### **Step 4: Wait for Alarm**

When the reminder is due, you'll see:

## 🔔 **What to Look For:**

### **✅ Good Signs:**
- `Starting reminder monitoring for X reminders`
- Regular checks every 10 seconds
- Reminder details showing correct time
- `TRIGGERING ALARM!` when due

### **❌ Problems to Check:**

#### **Problem 1: No Monitoring Logs**
```
🔔 Starting reminder monitoring for 0 reminders
```
**Solution**: You have no reminders. Create one!

#### **Problem 2: Wrong Time Format**
```
   - Due: Invalid Date
```
**Solution**: The reminder date format is wrong. Delete and recreate.

#### **Problem 3: Already Alerted**
```
   ⏭️  Skipping (already alerted)
```
**Solution**: This reminder already triggered. Create a new one.

#### **Problem 4: Too Far in Future**
```
   ⏰ Not due yet (120 minutes to go)
```
**Solution**: Wait, or set the reminder closer to now.

#### **Problem 5: Completed**
```
   ⏭️  Skipping (completed)
```
**Solution**: The reminder is marked complete. Uncheck it.

## 🔊 **Sound Troubleshooting:**

### **If You See "TRIGGERING ALARM!" But No Sound:**

#### **Check 1: Browser Volume**
- Is your system volume up?
- Is the browser tab muted?
- Check browser volume icon

#### **Check 2: Alarm Settings**
1. Go to reminders page
2. Click "Alarm Settings"
3. Make sure "Alarm Sound" is ON
4. Volume should be > 0
5. Click "Test Alarm" to verify sound works

#### **Check 3: Browser Console Errors**
Look for errors after "TRIGGERING ALARM!":
```
Failed to play alarm sound: [error]
```

If you see this, the audio context might need user interaction first.

#### **Check 4: Audio Context**
The Web Audio API requires user interaction before playing sounds.
- Click anywhere on the page first
- Then wait for the alarm
- This "unlocks" audio playback

## 📱 **Notification Troubleshooting:**

### **If No Notification Appears:**

#### **Check 1: Permission Status**
In console, type:
```javascript
Notification.permission
```

**Results:**
- `"granted"` = ✅ Notifications enabled
- `"default"` = ⚠️ Need to request permission
- `"denied"` = ❌ Notifications blocked

#### **Check 2: Enable Permissions**
1. Go to reminders page
2. Click "Alarm Settings"
3. Toggle "Browser Notifications" to ON
4. Click "Enable Notifications" when prompted
5. Click "Allow" in browser popup

#### **Check 3: Browser Settings**
- **Chrome**: Settings → Privacy → Site Settings → Notifications
- **Firefox**: Preferences → Privacy → Permissions → Notifications
- **Safari**: Preferences → Websites → Notifications

Make sure `localhost:3000` is allowed!
