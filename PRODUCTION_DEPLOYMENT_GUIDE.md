## 🔒 Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Security

- ✅ All API routes have authentication checks

3. **Enable Rate Limiting** - Use Vercel Edge Config or Upstash Redis
4. **Implement IP Whitelisting** - For sensitive admin routes
5. **Set Up Audit Logging** - Track all critical operations
6. **Regular Security Audits** - Schedule quarterly reviews
7. **Dependency Updates** - Weekly automated updates
8. **Backup Strategy** - Daily database backups
