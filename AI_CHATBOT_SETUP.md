## üéØ **WHAT THE AI CAN DO:**

### **Investment Analysis:**
```
User: "Should I invest in a Series A SaaS company with $3M ARR?"

AI: "Let me help you analyze this opportunity. Here are key factors to consider:

1. Growth Metrics: What's the MoM/YoY growth rate?
2. Unit Economics: LTV/CAC ratio should be 3:1 or better
3. Market Size: Is the TAM large enough ($1B+)?
4. Burn Rate: How many months of runway?
5. Competition: Defensible competitive advantage?

Based on typical Series A metrics:
- $3M ARR is solid for Series A
- Look for 15%+ MoM growth
- Expect ~$10-15M valuation range
- Focus on path to profitability

Would you like me to dive deeper into any of these areas?"
```

### **Valuation Help:**
```
User: "How should I value this company?"

AI: "I'll outline the main valuation methods for VC:

1. **Venture Capital Method:**
   - Exit Value = Revenue √ó Multiple
   - Pre-money = Exit Value / Target Return
   - Common for early stage

2. **Comparables:**
   - Public company multiples
   - Recent private deals
   - ARR multiples (5-15x typical for SaaS)

3. **DCF (if profitable):**
   - Future cash flows discounted
   - 30-50% discount rate typical
   
Tell me about the company's stage, revenue, and growth, and I'll help calculate a range."
```

### **Due Diligence:**
```
User: "Give me a due diligence checklist"

AI: "Comprehensive VC Due Diligence Checklist:

**Financial DD:**
‚òë 3 years of financials
‚òë Revenue recognition policies
