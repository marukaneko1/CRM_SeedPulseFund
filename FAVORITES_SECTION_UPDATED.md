## 📊 **View-Specific Data:**

Currently, all tabs show the same deal data (5 demo deals). In the future, you can:

1. Add different deal data for each pipeline
2. Filter deals by pipeline type
3. Connect to separate data sources for each

**To add pipeline-specific data**, you would update the `deals` variable to filter based on `activeView`:

```typescript
const deals = useMemo(() => {
  let filtered = isAdmin ? demoDeals : []
  
  // Pipeline-specific filtering
  if (activeView === 'fund-pipeline') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(d => d.pipeline === 'fund')
  } else if (activeView === 'gv-ventures') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(d => d.pipeline === 'gv')
  }
  // etc...
  
  return filtered
}, [activeView, isAdmin, /* other deps */])
```
