## 💡 Important Notes

### Database Status:
- **Current:** PostgreSQL configuration
- **Needs:** Valid DATABASE_URL in .env.local
- **Workaround:** Most features work without database (using mock data)

### AI Status:
- **API Key:** ✅ Validated and configured
- **Status:** ⚠️ Quota exceeded (needs billing)
- **Action:** Add billing at platform.openai.com
- **Cost:** $10-50/month recommended

### What Works Without Database:
- All UI components
- Navigation
- Forms and interactions
- Mock data displays
- File uploads (local storage)
- Messaging (in-memory)

### What Needs Database:
- Persistent data storage
- User management
- Real deal/contact tracking
- Notification persistence
