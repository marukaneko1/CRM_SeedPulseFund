## 🌐 **VERCEL DEPLOYMENT**

### **Automatic Deployment:**
Since your GitHub repository is connected to Vercel, the deployment will happen automatically:

1. **Vercel detects the push** to main branch
2. **Automatic build** starts
3. **Deployment** to production
4. **URL:** Your Vercel project URL will be updated

### **Manual Deployment (if needed):**
If automatic deployment doesn't trigger:

```bash
# Login to Vercel first
npx vercel login

# Then deploy
npx vercel --prod
```

Or use the Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy"

## 🔧 **IMPORTANT NOTES FOR PRODUCTION:**

### **WebSocket Server:**
⚠️ **Note:** The WebSocket server (for real-time features) needs to be deployed separately:

**Options:**
1. **Deploy WebSocket server to a separate service** (e.g., Railway, Render)
2. **Use a managed WebSocket service** (e.g., Pusher, Ably)
3. **Deploy to a server with WebSocket support**

**For now:** The app will work without real-time features (polling/manual refresh)

### **Environment Variables:**
Make sure these are set in Vercel:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Authentication secret
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Your production URL
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Email service key
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` - WebSocket server URL (when deployed)
