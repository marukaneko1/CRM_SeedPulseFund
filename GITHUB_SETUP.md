## 📝 **Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name:** `venture-studio-crm` (or any name you prefer)
3. **Description:** "All-in-one CRM platform for venture studios"
4. **Visibility:** Choose Private or Public
5. **DON'T** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

## 💻 **Step 2: Connect and Push to GitHub**

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
cd /Users/marukaneko/CRM_SeedPulseFund

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/venture-studio-crm.git

# Or if you prefer SSH:
# git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/venture-studio-crm.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔒 **Important: Environment Variables**

Your `.env` file is **already in .gitignore** ✅ so your secrets won't be uploaded.

**Sensitive data that is PROTECTED:**
- ✅ Database connection strings
- ✅ API keys (Resend, Google, etc.)

**On GitHub, you'll need to set these up separately for deployment.**
