## 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

### **Fixed Import Errors:**

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
import prisma from "@/lib/prisma" // ❌ Wrong
import { authOptions } from "@/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route" // ❌ Wrong
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma' // ✅ Correct
import { authOptions } from '@/lib/auth' // ✅ Correct
import {
  GmailAPI,
  GoogleCalendarAPI,
  GoogleDriveAPI,
  // ... other Google APIs
} from '@/lib/integrations/google-workspace' // ✅ Added
```

### **Updated Google Data Fetching:**

**Before (Using Internal API Calls):**
```typescript
// Made fetch calls to internal APIs
const calendarResponse = await fetch('/api/google-workspace/calendar-events')
```

**After (Direct API Access):**
```typescript
// Uses Google APIs directly
const calendarApi = new GoogleCalendarAPI(accessToken)
const calendarEvents = await calendarApi.listEvents(20)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ More efficient (no extra HTTP requests)
- ✅ Direct data access
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ Faster response times
- ✅ More reliable
