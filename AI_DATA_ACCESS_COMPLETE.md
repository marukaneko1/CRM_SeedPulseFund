## 🤖 **How the AI Uses Your Data:**

### **Context-Aware Responses:**

**Example 1 - Calendar Integration:**
```
User: "What should I prepare for tomorrow?"

AI: "Looking at your calendar, you have:
- Meeting with MetaProp at 10 AM
- Call with OpenAI team at 2 PM
- Due diligence review at 4 PM

For MetaProp, I see they're in your 'Target Lead' stage. Here's what to prepare..."
```

**Example 2 - Deal Analysis:**
```
User: "Give me a summary of my pipeline"

AI: "Based on your current data:

Active Deals: 5
- Helix (Target Lead) - Last contact: 7 hours ago
- Lacework (Initial Meeting) - No recent contact
- MetaProp (Target Lead) - Meeting in 5 hours
- OpenAI (Deep Diligence) - Strong connections
- Preply (Portfolio) - 101 connections

Recommendations:
1. Follow up with Lacework - no recent contact
2. Prepare for MetaProp meeting today..."
```

**Example 3 - Task Management:**
```
User: "What's on my plate?"

AI: "You have 12 pending tasks:
- [URGENT] Due Diligence for OpenAI (Due: Today)
- Follow up with Helix (Due: Tomorrow)
- Review pitch deck for MetaProp (Due: This week)

Would you like help prioritizing these?"
```

**Example 4 - Document Analysis:**
```
User: "Analyze the recent pitch deck I uploaded"

AI: "I see you uploaded 'MetaProp_Pitch_Deck.pdf' 2 days ago. 
Based on the file type and timing, this appears to be for your 
meeting with MetaProp today. Would you like me to help you 
prepare key questions based on their industry (Real Estate Tech)?"
```

**Example 5 - Email Context:**
```
User: "Help me draft a follow-up email"

AI: "I see your last email to Helix was 17 days ago with Gregory Hartley. 
Here's a draft that references your previous conversation..."
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

### **1. AI Context Builder (`lib/ai-context-builder.ts`):**

A comprehensive system that:
- Fetches all data sources in parallel (fast!)
- Formats data into readable context for AI
- Includes user info, timestamps, and metadata
- Handles errors gracefully

**Functions:**
```typescript
- buildAIContext(): Promise<AIContext>
  → Gathers all data from database and APIs

- formatAIContext(context): string
  → Formats data into readable text for AI

- getAIContextString(): Promise<string>
  → Returns complete formatted context
```

### **2. Updated AI Deal Assist API:**

**File:** `app/api/ai/deal-assist/route.ts`

**Changes:**
1. Imports `getAIContextString` from context builder
2. Fetches complete user context before each response
3. Includes context in system message to AI
4. Instructs AI on how to use the data

**System Message Structure:**
```
[User's Complete Data Context]
↓
[AI Role & Expertise]
↓
[Instructions on Using Data]
↓
[Examples of Context-Aware Responses]
```

## 📋 **Data Structure:**
