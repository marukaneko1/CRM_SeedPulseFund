- ✅ Branch: `main`
- ✅ Remote: `origin` (GitHub)
- ✅ Working tree: Clean
- ✅ All files committed

---

## 🔍 **HOW TO VERIFY YOUR LIVE WEBSITE:**

### **Step 1: Check GitHub**
1. Go to: https://github.com/marukaneko1/CRM_SeedPulseFund
2. Verify the latest commit shows: "📊 FINAL STATUS: 100% Core Button Functionality Complete!"
3. Check that the commit hash starts with `360510b`

### **Step 2: Check Vercel Dashboard**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your project: "CRM_SeedPulseFund"
3. Click on the project
4. Look at the "Deployments" tab
5. Verify the latest deployment shows commit `360510b`

### **Step 3: Check Deployment Status**
Look for one of these statuses:
- ✅ **Ready** - Your site is live with latest changes
- 🔄 **Building** - Deployment in progress (wait 2-3 minutes)
- ❌ **Error** - Check build logs for issues

### **Step 4: Access Your Live Site**
Your live URLs:
- **Production:** Check Vercel dashboard for your production URL
- **Preview:** Each deployment has a unique preview URL

## 🔄 **IF YOU DON'T SEE CHANGES:**

### **Option 1: Wait for Auto-Deploy (Recommended)**
Vercel automatically deploys when you push to GitHub:
- ⏱️ Typical deployment time: 2-3 minutes
- 🔄 Refresh your Vercel dashboard to see status
- ✅ Once status shows "Ready", your site is updated

### **Option 2: Manual Redeploy**
If auto-deploy didn't trigger:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Find the latest deployment
5. Click the three dots (•••)
6. Click "Redeploy"
7. Confirm the redeploy

### **Option 3: Force New Deployment**
I've just created an empty commit to trigger Vercel:
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Force redeploy"
git push origin main
```
This will force Vercel to redeploy.

## 🐛 **TROUBLESHOOTING:**

### **Issue: Vercel shows "Error" status**
**Solution:**
1. Click on the failed deployment
2. Check the "Build Logs"
3. Look for error messages
4. Common issues:
   - Environment variables not set
   - Database connection issues
   - Build errors (but we have zero errors!)

### **Issue: Changes don't appear on live site**
**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh your browser: `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try incognito/private window
4. Check if you're looking at the correct URL (production vs preview)

### **Issue: Vercel not auto-deploying**
**Solution:**
1. Check Vercel project settings
2. Ensure GitHub integration is connected
3. Verify "Production Branch" is set to `main`
4. Check if deployments are paused
